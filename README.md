# Spotify Notifier

Spotify Notifier is a Mac OS X application that shows the current playing track on Spotify and lets you receive notifications when the current song changes.

You can directly launch Spotify Notifier without launching Spotify, it will launch Spotify for you and close itself when you close Spotify so you don't have to it manually.

Spotify should be installed in Applications -> Spotify.app for this application to work properly.
